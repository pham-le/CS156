Homework 2:

Find specific board setups for the 8 queens problem that satisfy the following criteria:

1.  Beam search with two starting points will not give the same result as hillclibing with a single restart:

	This will happen when the every node adjacent to the first starting has a greater cost than the cheapest 2 nodes of the second starting point, but the first starting point ultimately leads to a better position.  Hillclimbing with a restart will continue with the expensive board until it can't climb anymore, while beam search will immediately move to the seemingly "closer" board and not look at the board 1 after the first move.


Queens are respresented with "QQ", spaces are represented by their cost (only relevant costs are filled):


Board 1: cost: 8
best move costs 4

Nodes here are more expensive now, but hillclimbing will find a solution eventually, while beam search will ditch it and get stuck in board 2.

Board 2: cost: 4
best moves cost 1

This board is very "close" at first glance, but leads to a local minimum, and not a solution.  Beam search will move the first starting point to a node branching from this, and never find a solution.
