Homework 3:

1. Suppose we have a two person game. In a given ply, a player can make one of three moves. The value of a move for a player can be encoded in three bits, one for sign, and two to encode a number 1-4. We use the variable Vm1,...,mi,b to denote the bth bit of the value of the sequence of moves m1,...mi to MAX. Suppose a game ends after 4 plys. Express as three propositional formulas the backed up minimax value of move 1, V1,b for each bit b, in terms of the variables V1,m2,m3,m4,b. Convert these formulas to CNF.


2. The pigeonhole principle PHPn+1n says any function from n+1 pigeons into n holes must result in two pigeons in the same hole. Let Pi,j be a variable expressing that pigeon i gets mapped to hole j. Consider the n=3 case. Express the following as propositional formulas:
Every i gets mapped to some j.
Some j is mapped to by i and i′ where i≠i′.
The conjunction of these two statements is a propositional formula for PHP43. Convert ¬PHP43 to clausal form and give a resolution refutation for this statement. Finally, trace the execution of DPLL on this formula.
