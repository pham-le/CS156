Problem 9.10. Write the riddle down in the prenex normal form with a CNF formula inside the quantifiers.
A popular children's riddle is `13rothers and sisters have I none, but that man's father is my father's son." Use the rules of the family domain (Section 8.3.2 on page 301) to show who that man is. You may apply any of the inference methods described in this chapter. Why do you think that this riddle is difficult?

Problem 9.23
From "Horses are animals," it follows that "The head of a horse is the head of an animal." Demonstrate that this inference is valid by carrying out the following steps:
a. Translate the premise and the conclusion into the language of first-order logic. Use three predicates: fl &IAN (h, or) (meaning "h is the head of x"), Horse (x), and Animal(x).
b. Negate the conclusion, and convert the premise and the negated conclusion into con-junctive normal form.
c. Use resolution to show that the conclusion follows from the premise.


Draw the planning graph for the problem in Figure 10.3 in the book. Solve the problem step-by-step using the GraphPlan algorithm.


Briefly explain how PDDL solves the frame problem. Give some disadvantages to formulating problems in PDDL.


Extend the default rules for the Nixon-Diamond presented in the book on p.460 by rules x	so that rather than having two extensions, the resulting system has three. Give what those three extensions are and show carefully they are in fact extensions.
